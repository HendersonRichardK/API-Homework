The chart below shows various outcomes at the 10th, 50th, and 90th percentile.

Percentile | Cumulative Returns
-----------|------------------
10th percentile |117.37594573549154
50th percentile |189.84383253943383
90th percentile |374.69326161033706

The projected value of an inital investment of $20,000 ranges from $234,000 to $750,000.

Percentile | Value
-----------|----------------
10th percentile | $2347519.0
50th percentile | $3796877.0
90th percentile | $7493865.0
----------------------------------
Harold's current projected annual income is $7,389.  Assuming a 4% withdrawal rate in 30 years on a $50,000 inital investment, Harold's projected portfolio would not suffice.  
------------------------------------------------
Income with an 4% withdrawal rate at the 10th percentile: $4,858.

A 50% increase in the initial investment ($75,000) would still not be enough due to Harolds current income.
---------------------------------------------------
Income with an 4% withdrawal rate with an $75k initial investment: $7,287.45

## Summary

Harold's plan to retire in 5 years is very unlikely.  For Harold to retire in  30 years, Harold needs to invest more than $50,000, and seriously re-evaluate his spending habits
